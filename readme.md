# Basic-Js-Projects

This repository documents my journey in learning JavaScript through simple, hands-on projects. Each project, while basic, represents a step in my learning process, focusing on a specific concept or skill I'm working to understand. These mini-projects serve as practical exercises to help me grasp how different JavaScript concepts apply in real-world scenarios, even at a beginner level. By building these foundational projects, I'm creating a visual record of my progress and reinforcing my understanding of core JavaScript principles.
